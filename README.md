# Campfire ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ

The repository for my conference demos, etc. from Jhey Tompkins.

## Develop a demo
```
mkdir -pv <DEMO_DIRECTORY>
make create DEMO=<DEMO_DIRECTORY>
make develop DEMO=<DEMO_DIRECTORY>
make develop-conf CONF=<CONF_DIRECTORY>
```

__NOTE::__ Make a certificate for `https://` usage locally first with `mkcert` in the repo root.

## TODO
- Bring in Plop.js
- Any refinements we can make
- Could be the demos that are tricky
